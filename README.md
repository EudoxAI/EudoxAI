EudoxAI

EudoxAI is an advanced AI bot designed to automatically interpret NASA telemetry data through photographic analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques, EudoxAI decodes, visualizes, and contextualizes NASA’s space imagery for scientific research and exploration purposes.

🌌 What EudoxAI Does

EudoxAI processes NASA-provided telemetry images and extracts meaningful scientific data through AI-driven analysis. Key features include:

🔭 Data Interpretation

Image Classification: Categorizes celestial objects like planets, moons, stars, and spacecraft components.

Telemetry Decoding: Converts embedded telemetry data into readable metrics, such as temperature, radiation levels, and spacecraft coordinates.

🛰️ Space Monitoring

Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual occurrences such as solar flares, atmospheric changes, and equipment malfunctions.

Mission Tracking: Monitors ongoing space missions, providing mission control insights through photo-based analysis.

📊 Scientific Insights

Data Visualization: Converts raw data into detailed, interactive charts and heatmaps.

Historical Comparisons: Compares current data with past missions for trend analysis.

🚀 How It Works

Data Upload: Upload NASA telemetry photos to the platform.

AI Analysis: EudoxAI automatically processes and interprets the data.

Insights Generation: Receive detailed scientific reports, visuals, and alerts.
