# EudoxAI Architecture

EudoxAI is designed to automatically interpret NASA telemetry data from provided photos and upload meaningful insights to the Twitter account @EudoxAI. Below is the technical structure of the project, detailing how each component interacts to achieve this functionality.

---

## Technical Structure

### **1. Input Data Handling**
- **Purpose:** Accept telemetry photos from NASA as input for processing.
- **Components:**
  - `src/input_handler.py`: Reads and validates uploaded images.
  - `data/`: Stores sample images and user-uploaded files temporarily.
- **Process Flow:**
  1. User uploads an image via the interface.
  2. The input handler verifies the file format and resolution.

### **2. Image Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Process telemetry images to extract meaningful data.
- **Components:**
  - `src/image_processor.py`: Core AI module for analyzing images.
  - Pre-trained AI models stored in `src/models/`.
- **Key Features:**
  - Object classification (e.g., celestial objects, spacecraft).
  - Telemetry data extraction (e.g., radiation levels, coordinates).
  - Anomaly detection (e.g., unusual heat signatures).

### **3. Data Interpretation and Visualization**
- **Purpose:** Convert raw data into human-readable insights.
- **Components:**
  - `src/data_interpreter.py`: Decodes and interprets extracted telemetry data.
  - `src/visualization.py`: Generates charts, heatmaps, and summaries.
- **Outputs:**
  - JSON files with structured data.
  - PNG/JPEG images for charts and visualizations.

### **4. Twitter Integration**
- **Purpose:** Automatically post updates to the @EudoxAI Twitter account.
- **Components:**
  - `src/twitter_bot.py`: Uses the Twitter API to post insights.
  - Twitter Developer Credentials stored securely.
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Data insights are formatted into a tweet.
  2. Charts and images are attached to the tweet.
  3. The bot posts updates to @EudoxAI.

### **5. Workflow Automation**
- **Purpose:** Ensure smooth and automated data processing.
- **Components:**
  - `src/main.py`: Orchestrates the entire workflow.
  - `scripts/`: Contains deployment and automation scripts.
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Main script triggers the image analysis pipeline.
  2. Results are interpreted, visualized, and tweeted.
  3. Logs are maintained for debugging and tracking.

### **6. Testing and Validation**
- **Purpose:** Ensure system reliability and accuracy.
- **Components:**
  - `tests/test_image_processor.py`: Validates image analysis algorithms.
  - `tests/test_twitter_bot.py`: Ensures correct Twitter integration.
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Run unit tests before deploying changes.
  2. Simulate edge cases for anomaly detection and data extraction.

### **7. Deployment**
- **Purpose:** Deploy the bot to a cloud environment for 24/7 operation.
- **Components:**
  - Docker container for portability.
  - Cloud provider setup (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
- **Deployment Workflow:**
  1. Build and deploy the application using `Docker`.
  2. Set up a cron job or cloud scheduler for periodic checks.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Telemetry Feeds:** Integrate directly with NASAâ€™s live telemetry API.
- **Multi-Platform Posting:** Expand beyond Twitter to other platforms like Instagram.
- **User Interaction:** Add features for users to query specific data points.

EudoxAI combines the power of artificial intelligence and automation to make space exploration data more accessible and engaging. This architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of use.
